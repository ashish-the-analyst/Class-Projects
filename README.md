Various R projects for Statistical programming

For this given project, we were given an article "The evidential value
of microspectrophotometry measurements made for pen inks" by Martyna et
al. Three color systems were used for ten replicates of each of forty
inks. 

The question of interest is whether or not there is a relationship between
the marginal LRâ€™s (i.e. LLR.x, LLR.y, and LLR.z) and the Omnibus LR 
(i.e. Omni.LLR.int). If there is a relationship, please characterize said relationship.

 

i)    Provide a two to three-page write-up (the page count does not include graphs, 
typeset equations, and tables) explaining your analysis of the experiment and the 
conclusions you can draw from it.  This can be done in a Word document, in 
RMarkdown, or another text editor, but submit a PDF.

ii)  Prepare a short slide/PowerPoint presentation on your findings and recommendations.

iii) As a final component provide annotated code that replicates your analysis. Upload 
as an .R or .RMD file.

Make sure to discuss any concerns about the modeling assumptions used in your analysis.
